Equalizer APO Profile Switcher. 
A one click "Include" switcher. When you don't want to bother turning on and off every include to switch headphones or speaker.

IF you are going to use this software, please backup all your config files before using. The way this software works is to copy all the contents of the config.txt, manipulate it, creates a config.txt file with the manipulated contents, and then replacing existing config.txt file (by first deleting the un-edited config.txt) with the manipulated one.

I will not be held responsible for any loss and/or damages caused to your config files. This is an experimental software, use at your own risk.
